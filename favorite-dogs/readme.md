# Favorite dogs

Create a React webapp that will present a gallery of 6 random dog images from https://random.dog/woof.json. Allow user to choose one (or
more) to favorite (use local storage).
If user doesnâ€™t like any of the six, use a refresh/next button to get 6 more. Repeat.
There should be two endpoints.
/ - described above
/favorites - displays all the favorite dogs
Consider making the screen a flexbox so that it arranges itself correctly for mobile screens.
